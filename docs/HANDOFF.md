# Handoff

> This file is rewritten at the end of every session. Read after CLAUDE.md.
>
> **Every session MUST start by reading [RCA.md](./RCA.md) end-to-end.** New entries get added after every bug fix or security change. Scan the most recent 5 entries and the "Patterns to watch for" table before writing any new code — they encode the real mistakes this codebase has made, and repeating them is the #1 way to introduce regressions.

## Current state as of 2026-04-16 (session 18 — Jobs Review page UX polish + signals)

**Branch:** `master` (HEAD: `7e10ca9`)
**Live site:** [automateedge.cloud](https://automateedge.cloud)
**VPS:** SSH alias `a11yos-vps` (72.61.227.64). Deploy root: `/srv/roadmap/`. Backend healthy.
**Tests:** **431 passed** (no new tests this session — purely frontend/template changes). 1 pre-existing unrelated failure (`test_skills_with_no_curriculum_match` — fails on parent commits too).

### Sessions 15–17 — single-thread arc on AI Jobs classification

The whole arc started with one motivating example: PhonePe **"Manager, Legal"** got ingested with `Topic = ["Applied ML"]` because the JD said *"LLB / LLM from a recognized university"* and Gemini Flash conflated **M**aster of **L**aws with **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odel. Investigation revealed 268+ historical false positives across Tier-1 sources (Anthropic, Databricks, xAI, Cerebras, etc.).

**Result:** 10-layer classification defense system across RCA-026 + Waves 1–5 #18. **268 historical false positives backfilled**, **115 new tests** in `test_jobs_cost_opt.py`, full developer reference in [docs/JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md](./JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md), admin-facing sections #7+#8 added to `/admin/jobs-guide`.

## What's live (10 defense layers, in pipeline order)

1. `is_non_ai_title()` — ~120 substring patterns across 21 categories
2. `has_non_ai_jd_signals()` — ≥2 cluster hits AND intensity < 5
3. `is_bare_verb_title()` — Manager/Director/Lead w/o AI anchor + low intensity
4. `compute_ai_intensity()` — 3-tier weighted score, threshold 5, dedup, boilerplate stripped, requirement-phrases neutralized
5. SELF-REJECTION rules in both system prompts (21-category list)
6. `_validate_topic_with_evidence()` — Wave 5 #18: anti-hallucination + per-topic forbidden patterns
7. `_enforce_topic_anchors()` — each topic must have JD anchor
8. `_enforce_designation_topic_consistency()` — Other ⇒ []; AI-adjacent capped at 1
9. `check_source_rejection_rates()` — auto-disable >40% reject sources at end of daily ingest
10. Weekly Opus audit — Mon 04:30 UTC cron picks 1% Tier-1 published; admin reviews via COPY PROMPT button → VS Code Claude Max → POST `/api/audit-submit`

Wave 5 #19 (two-stage classifier) **deliberately not shipped** — cost-benefit unfavorable post-Waves 1–5; revisit only if observability (Layers 9, 10) reveals new failure patterns.

## Documentation map

- **Developer reference:** [docs/JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md](./JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md) — all 10 layers with code locations, calibration data, configuration constants, and "Adding a new defense layer" guidance
- **Admin user guide:** [/admin/jobs-guide](../backend/app/routers/admin.py) sections #7, #8, #10 — classification layers, Opus audit workflow, and new "Reading the Dashboard Signals" reference covering KPI tiles / histogram / noisy sources / audit staleness
- **Bug records:** [docs/RCA.md](./RCA.md) RCA-026 (LLM-as-law-degree fix) + RCA-027 (f-string outage from this session)
- **Backfill script:** `python scripts/backfill_rca026_non_ai.py --apply` — idempotent, runs Layers 1+2+3 against historical rows

## RCA-027 (this session) — production hotfix + structural fix

After deploying the admin guideline (commit `7585db0`), the backend crashed with `NameError: name 'job_id' is not defined` because `_JOBS_GUIDE_HTML` is an f-string and my new section had literal `{job_id, agreed, ...}` and `{"results":[...]}` JSON in `<code>` blocks. Same root cause as RCA-024 (JS strings in f-strings). Hotfix `784f8d8` doubled all literal braces. Down ~5 minutes.

**Structural fix shipped same session (commit `4a79082`):** migrated the entire 313-line `_JOBS_GUIDE_HTML` to a proper Jinja2 template at `backend/app/templates/admin/jobs_guide.html`. Jinja2 inverts the brace semantics (`{` is literal by default; `{{ var }}` is interpolation) so adding HTML/JSON/code samples can no longer crash module import. Per CLAUDE.md "no compat shims" — the legacy f-string was removed entirely (315 lines deleted from admin.py), not kept as fallback. 4 new tests guard against regression. Pattern documented in [docs/JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md](./JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md) "Jinja2 migration" section.

Other admin f-strings (templates page 141 lines, users page 76 lines, dashboard 37 lines) left as-is — below the high-risk threshold (no code samples, lower edit frequency).

## Next session

**Primary action: measure for 1–2 weeks.** The Wave 4 observability stack (rejection-rate alarm, intensity histogram, weekly Opus audit) surfaces drift automatically. The Jobs Review page now has full signal coverage — KPI tiles, intensity histogram, noisy-source table, auto-disabled guardrail count, last-audit staleness, and 7d-published throughput chip. No new code work needed unless:

- Admin reports a false positive that slipped through all 10 layers → identify which layer should have caught it, add patterns/anchors per [docs/JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md](./JOBS_CLASSIFICATION.md) "Adding a new defense layer" section
- Drift detection (Layer 9 auto-disable or Layer 10 audit mismatch) reveals a systematic gap → may revisit Wave 5 #19 (two-stage classifier)

**Outstanding (verified live state 2026-04-16 session 17 close):**

1. Submit `sitemap_index.xml` to Google Search Console (manual one-time admin task)
2. Set `INDEXNOW_KEY` in `.env` (currently empty — IndexNow notifications fail silently; minor SEO loss, not a bug)
3. **Editorial uplift queued (commit `4a79082` bumped `PROMPT_VERSION` to `2026-04-16.2`):** 669 Flash-era + 297 prior-Opus rows are now stale. Run `/summarize-jobs --status published --limit 100` (or similar) when convenient. $0 API spend (Claude Max in VS Code), only manual paste-cycle time.

**Recently dropped (verified done):** Gemini API key (rotated prior session); `/summarize-jobs --status draft` (962/962 drafts already have summaries).

**Future migration (deferred, not urgent):** other admin f-string blobs (templates page 141 lines, users page 76 lines) could be migrated to Jinja2 too — but they're below the high-risk threshold. Only do this if one of them gets a code-sample edit that requires brace-doubling.

**Open questions for the user:** None.
